## Welcome to Davie B-B-Brueny's far-out, pyschodelic, groovy contact aggregator :smiley:
This ASP.NET .NET Framework MVC app reads 3 .txt files of company contacts with different delimiters (comma, hyphen, hash) and fields. 
The controller puts them into a list.  The view (.cshtml) puts them into a table that's sortable asc & desc by some column headings, with arrow icons indicating the current sort order.
It also has a button to export the contacts in the current sort order on the page to .csv.  :thumbsup:
