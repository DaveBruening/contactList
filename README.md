# contactList
MVC contact list
Hello.  This is a to-do list made in ASP.NET Core Web API, invoked by JavaScript in an HTML page.
It's based on __Tutorial: Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript | Microsoft Docs__, which is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-5.0).<br/>
I added some neat features , like:<br/> 
-	Recording the active to-do items in an unordered list instead of a table<br/>


# Welcome to Davie B-B-Brueny's far-out, pyschodelic, groovy contact aggregator :smiley:
This ASP.NET .NET Framework MVC app reads 3 .txt files of company contacts with different delimiters (comma, hyphen, hash) and fields. 
The controller puts them into a list.  The view (.cshtml) puts them into a table that's sortable asc & desc by some column headings, with arrow icons indicating the current sort order.
It also has a button to export the contacts in the current sort order on the page to .csv.  :thumbsup:
